# Welcome IAs of 4156

Please follow the IA grading rubric while grading my unit tests, bug slaying skills and style B) 

I utilized the quickstart ruleset defined in rulesets/java/quickstart.xml
and, to run the bug finder on macOS, use this command: 

```
pmd check -d ./src -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -f text
```
