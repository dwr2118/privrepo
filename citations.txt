I got a refresher on all of the assertions that are possible with jUnit 
like assertEquals, assertTrue and much more from their official javadoc found here:
https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html.

To help with cleanup and initializations of my unit tests, I had to learn
the different annotation interfaces supported by jUnit like BeforeAll and 
AfterAll; cited from their official javadoc: 
https://javadoc.io/doc/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api/latest/org/junit/jupiter/api/package-summary.html.

To learn more about the Locale bug I was coming across,
I read more about the functionality in this article: 
https://beginnersbook.com/2013/12/java-string-tolowercase-method-example/ and 
then referred to the official javadoc here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html
for the implementation.

I utilized the lecture materials located in this file:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_lnasYt5MviTXMk9AVi7K6UJGFhkSL_p52yB4O3b98g/edit#slide=id.g2908ed65fea_0_213
to learn more about GitHub Actions and how to make my own simple workflows
for the current state of my miniproject. Initially, I was confused as to why 
I was getting an error from the runner stating that the POM file couldn't be located
but then I remembered we have to explicitly change its directory to the one 
that stores pom.xml. Afterwards, we can have it run mvn test B)
